Known issues:

Q: It gives "Error invalid icon name" even if the icon is from the game.
A: This is because it was not to the database yet , please report the icon name and i will update the program or add it under database->Icons->Add current in the menu.

Q: A valid command gives unknown command.
A: Command wasn't for some reason in the list i got and wasn't added, just tell me which and i will add it.
